If you've ever logged into a Linux server via SSH and been greeted with a "You have mail" message, you might wonder what it is and how to remove it. Turns out that various linux packages use this as a dumping location to notify the user of something. In my case, it was 40k lines, mostly blank. Regardless, I wanted to remove the log in message.


### The Problem

In my case, I didn't have a mail client like `mail`, `mutt`, or `alpine` installed, nor did I have permissions to install one. Additionally, I lacked the necessary privileges to delete my mail file directly; though I'm not sure that is a good item.

### The Solution

Even though I couldn't delete the file, I found that I had write permissions, which allowed me to empty it safely using the following command:

```
cat /dev/null > /var/spool/mail/$USER
```

This effectively clears the mailbox while preserving the file itself, avoiding potential system issues that might arise from outright deletion.
