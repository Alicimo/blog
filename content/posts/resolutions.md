I've never been much of a new year resolution person. I conceptually disagree with the New Year, New You philosophy. Drastic changes are never easily maintained; and even less so when announced publicly according to the science. However, goals that expand upon your existing lifestyle are far more reasonable. This combined with my blog being unknown (and as of yet only local) meaning this is the most minimal of announcements.

Given this, here are some things I would like to achieve/change in 2025:

Fitness:
- Main: Increased fitness
- Accessory:
	- Lifting goals (hit novice level targets):
		- .75 x BW Bench
		- 1.25 x BW Squat
		- 1.5 x BW Deadlift
	- 10x Pull-ups
	- 10x Chin-ups
	- 5k Jogs
	- 90 kg body weight

Productivity:
- Main: More time spent on personal goals & projects
- Accessory:
	- Better use of ToDo Lists and/or Kanban
	- Calendar TimeBlocking
	- Prioritise project completion

German:
- Main: B2 Level
- Accessory:
	- Anki A2 + B1
	- Duolingo 365 day streak
	- Consume media in German.

Chess:
- Main: Reach 1600 rating
- Accessory:
	- Structured learning, e.g., puzzles, books, apps
	- No more short-time games
	- Scheduled sessions for games
